## Higher Order Functions
- You can pass a function as a parameter
- You can chain arguments
    - `coolAssFunction(Math.min)([1, 2, 3])`
- HOFs ussually operate on arrays
- `Array.prototype.reduce(previous, current)` opperates against the last position in the array and the current position in the arry.
    - need to use a call back function (not arrow)

## Anonymous Functions
> A higher order function is a function that either takes another function as an argument or returns a function.
- Currly braces around return. If it's just basic bool, use round brace
- Arrow functions are un-named
- Two Syntaxes for "arrow functions"
    ```
    (argument) => {
        let x = 'something';
        return x + argument;
    }
    ```
    ```
    function(arguemnt) { 
        let x = 'something';
        return argument + x;
        }
    ```
    ## ES6
    - Short for ECMA 6 (the base scripting language node compiles to)
    - '... for in' allows us to loop through everything without creating a loop.
        - easier to read
    - [Sperad Operator](#spread)
    - Default paramaters. Used to establish baseline if no data is passed.
    - Template literalls \` (backticks) \` 
        - Allows embeding of var within strings: 
        ```console.log(`Output: ${someVariable}`)```
    
    ## Spread 
    - expressed as `...obj`
    - opens everythying in the array without actually looping it
