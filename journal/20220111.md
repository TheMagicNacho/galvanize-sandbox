## Thoughts on recursion
- need to learn recursive patterns and get good at them
- always include a Base Case (the Kick)
- opening a function recursively opens a new version of the function; all the itterators restart

## Branch Naming Best practice
- Trainers recomend: userstory ID - verb - branch number
    * I need to think about a standard for naming
- Need to research how to write commit messages too
