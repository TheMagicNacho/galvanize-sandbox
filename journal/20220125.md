## Important Concepts

- JS is single threaded and operates with the event loop
- It's important to understand the eventloop to understand how JS will manage the stack so we know how to leverage async


- [node event loop explained](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/event-loop-timers-and-nexttick/#event-loop-explained)
- [IBM blog on node event loop](https://developer.ibm.com/learningpaths/get-started-nodejs/intro-to-event-loops/)
