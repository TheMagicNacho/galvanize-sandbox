# OOP

## Encapculation
getter = private 
```js
    get name() {
        return this._name;
    }
```
setter = public
```js
    //syntactic sugar...
    set name(value) {
        this._name = value;
    }
```
## Private Methods, Classes, and Variables
~~I also read  in the o'reily book you can use # as a prefix to set private, but I don't understand how that works~~

Adding a # to the front of something makes that item private to the class.
```js
class ClassWithPrivateField {
  #privateField;

  constructor() {
    this.#privateField = 42;
  }
}

class SubClass extends ClassWithPrivateField {
  #subPrivateField;

  constructor() {
    super();
    this.#subPrivateField = 23;
  }
}

new SubClass();
// SubClass {#privateField: 42, #subPrivateField: 23}

```


## Class
Here is the safe and explicit way of doing classses 
```js
class MyClassName {
    constructor(){ <- you don't need this but why not
        let #coolVar = 0; <- private variable
    }
    get name1(){ <- private method

    }
    set name2(){ <- public method

    }
}
```
```js
class NewClass extends MyClassName {
    constructor(){ <- you don't need this but why not
        super(); <- this bad lary is manditory and will pass arguments to the upper class
        let #coolVar = 0; <- private variable
    }
    get name1(){ <- private method

    }
    set name2(){ <- public method

    }
}
```
